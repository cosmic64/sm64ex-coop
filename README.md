# IOS-coop
Online multiplayer mod for SM64 that synchronizes all entities and every level for multiple players. Fork of [sm64pc/sm64ex](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex). 

Feel free to report bugs and contribute, but remember, there must be **no upload of any copyrighted asset**.

## How to Play

[Instructions on how to play are available on the wiki.](https://github.com/djoslin0/sm64ex-coop/wiki/How-to-Play)

- The easiest way is to download [coop-compiler](https://github.com/coop-compiler/coop-compiler/releases/latest/download/coop-compiler.exe)

## Goal (accomplished)
Create a mod for the PC port where multiple people can play together online.

Unlike previous multiplayer projects, this one synchronizes enemies and events. This allows players interact with the same world at the same time.

## Lua
